----- Eclipse (Kepler) -----

1) Configure facets
 * Right click on the "project name" (Angular) in Navigator / Project Explorer
 * Select 'properties'
 * Open 'Project Facets'
 * Select the following facets
  > Dynamic Web Module | 3.0 (or 3.1) > Further configuration >
                                        - Context Root: Angular
                                        - Content Directory: src/main/webapp
                                        - Leave 'generate web.xml' unchecked
  > NOTE: This will enable you the project property 'Deployment assembly' and makes it
    available to deploy the project onto container
  > Java               | 1.7
  > JavaScript         | 1.0


----- Project structure -----

To have "java like" project structure and to avoid having too large javascript & html file clusters, the web content is
structured as follows:
 * /src/main/java/ (Nothing as you probably don't want to have any java with this project)
 * /src/main/resources/META-INF/manifest.mf (Not needed actually)
 * /src/main/WEB-INF/web.xml (This is needed for the container to tell where to start when the app is accessed with
   browser)
  > e.g. http://localhost:8080/Angular => localhost:8080/Angular/app/phonenbook.html
                                       => http://localhost:8080/Angular/#/ajeer
 * /src/main/js/         | If you want some javascript that is not involved with Angular, put it here
 * /src/main/webapp/app/ | All the stuff you want to involve the Angular with
  > css                  | The style sheets
  > img                  | Images used
  > lib                  | Here will be all the libraries needed by Angular itself to function
  > views                | The (sub) views used by Angular to render the content on page the app.js directs to
   - templates             | The html-templates used by the directives
  > js                   | The actual Angular stuff
   - controllers           | The scripts per (sub)page, handling actions done in them
   - directives            | If you want to add custom functionality that affects the page rendering, put the
                             instructions here
   - services              | Functionality common to different controllers can be put here
 * /src/main/webapp/app/app.js          | This file will function as the navigation controller. It will parse the url
                                          and select what to render based on the url parts it finds
 * /src/main/webapp/app/phonenbook.html | This will act as the starting point for the whole application.
                                          The file will include all the scripts needed to load Angular and will provide
                                          the basic layout for the whole SPA (Single Page Application)
