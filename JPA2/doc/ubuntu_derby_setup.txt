Installing all the required components:

1) Install oracle java (note, you may need to enable the 'multiverse' repository):

- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java

2) Install derby (do not use 'open' java)

>>
sudo apt-get install sun-javadb-client sun-javadb-core
<<
 set to environment variables (e.g. in ~/.bashrc):
>>
 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/javadb/bin/
 export DERBY_HOME=/usr/share/javadb
<<

3) You may need to change the permissions for the 'derby.log' file in $DERBY_HOME
>>
 cd $DERBY_HOME
 sudo chmod 666 derby.log
<<

4) You may need to change security setting to use derby
>>
 sudo vi $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.policy
<<
You need to add this line to the 'grants'
>>
 permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:1527", "listen";
<<

After the mentioned edits, you should be able to start derby by calling (anywhere)
>>
 startNetworkServer
<<

You may also add this to be a daemon process (starts automatically) when the computer starts
